    This function takes a list and splits it's into smaller sublists by calling itself recursively, which then are
    merged by the merge function. The function finds the middle point to divide the array into two halves.
    Then the function is recursively called for the first half, and again for the second half.
    Finally, we call the merge function to merge the these halves, which sorts the sublist.

    E.G.  For a list that has 8 elements, the left index is 0, middle is 3 and right is 7.

    During the first recursion, the left_index is 0 while the right_index is 3. Here the middle_index is now 1.
    The function calls itself, passing 0 and 1 and left and right indexes, but when the function calls itself again,
    but as the middle index is now 0, the left_index isn't smaller than the right so the loop stops.
    Then the second recursion for where the left is the middle_index + 1 and the right index is itself.
    In this example the left index would be 2 (1+1) and the right would be 3. The function calls itself, but now the
    middle index is (2+3) // 2 which returns 2. The function tried to call itself again, the left is 3 (2+1) and the
    right is still 3, but as left is no longer smaller than the right, this stops the loop.

    This then continues for the 2nd half of the array ( here the left array is middle + 1 and right is itself)
    The left index here is then 4 and right is 7, with 5 being the middle array. This then repeats similarly to above,

    The entire unsorted list is passed into the function. The array is then drawn using the draw data function.
    We split the array into the l_array and r_array (left array takes the values of the unsorted list between
    left index and middle index  while right array is between middle index and right index).

    Then set the l_array_index to 0 and right_array_index to 0, with the sorted_index equal to left_index parameter -
    this determines where the sorting of the array will be taking place.
    Check if the length of both l_array and r_array and longer than their set arrays (is true as index is set to 0
    and the array is populated, but becomes false once the values is compared as the array index is increased and
    becomes equal or greater than the length of the array - for array of size 1 this is true after one comparison).

    If the element of the l_array is smaller or equal to the element of the r_array at their indices, set the value of
    the unsorted_list at index sorted_index equal to the l_array at l_array_index - e.g. if the l_array is [1] and
    r_array is [7] and sorted_index is 0, then we set the unsorted_list at index 0 to l_array at index 0.
    Therefor the array remains unchanged while l_array_index and sorted_index are increased by 1.

    Otherwise, (if the element of the l_array is greater than r_array) we set the value of the unsorted_list at index
    of sorted_index (0) equal to the r_array at r_array index (0) - e.g. if l_array_is [10] amd r_array is [7] and
    sorted_index is 0, then we set the unsorted_list at index 0 to r_array at index r_array 0.
    Therefor the array now has the copied the [7] into the first position, but the 2nd array is still not swapped.
    The first 2 elements of the unsorted_list go from [10,7] to [7,7].

    After this, the array_index and sorted_index are increased by 1, and these checks are continued until
    the array_index is no longer smaller than the list of that array (e.g. if the l_array and r_array have only 1
    element, the loop only happens once, but is either array has more than 1 element, this can loop several times)

    Then we check if the l_array_index and r_array_index are smaller than the length of these arrays.
    If the previous loop is exited because one of the array is no gone through, then the other array will have its
    array index smaller than it's length, where this loop would then happen. In this loop we check for remaining
    elements of that index and set the value of the elements in the unsorted list to the remaining elements of that
    array, increasing both sorted_index and array_index by 1 until we've gone through them all (and the array_index is
    no longer smaller than its length). This would ensure the values of the elements are swapped and the sublist is
    sorted. (e.g. if the r_array was smaller than the l_array, then l_array_index would be 0, r_array_index would be 1 and
    sorted_index would be 1. Therefor, the l_array_index WOULD be smaller than the l_array length, where we would set
    the element at index sorted_index (1) of the unsorted_list equal to element of l_array at l_array_index (0) -)
    so if l_array was [10] and r_array was [7], then after the unsorted_list copied the element of the r_array into
    index 0, the first to elements go from [10,7] to [7,7]. This check would then set the index 1 of the unsorted_list
    to the first element of the l_array , therefore unsorted_list goes from [7,7] to [7,10] completing the swap.)
